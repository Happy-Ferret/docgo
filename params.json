This creates the file `source.html` in the current directory, a\r\nself-contained HTML page containing your annotated source code.\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n------\r\n\r\nWritten by [Daniel Connelly](http://dhconnelly.com) (<dhconnelly@gmail.com>).\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\ndocgo is released under a BSD-style license, described here and in the\r\n`LICENSE.md` file:\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012, Daniel Connelly.
